For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

PMG1 MCU devices support a USB PD block that integrates Type-C terminations, comparators, and the Power Delivery transceiver required to detect the attachment of a partner device and negotiate power contracts with it.

On reset, the USB PD block is initialized with the following settings:

   - The receiver clock input of the block is connected to a 12-MHz PERI-derived clock.

   - The transmitter clock input of the block is connected to a 600-kHz PERI-derived clock.

   - The 8-bit SAR ADC clock input of the block is connected to a 1-MHz PERI-derived clock.

   - The 8-bit SAR ADC in the USB PD block is configured to measure the VBUS_TYPE-C voltage through an internal divider.

This application uses the PDStack middleware library in a DRP role.

**Figure 1. Firmware flowchart**

<img src = "images/usbpd_drp_flow.png" width = "400"/>
<br>

The PDStack middleware library configures the USB PD block on the PMG1 MCU device to detect Type-C connection state changes and USB PD messages, and notify the stack through callback functions. The callback function registers the pending tasks, which are then handled by PDStack through the `Cy_PdStack_Dpm_Task` function. This function is expected to be called at appropriate times from the main processing loop of the application.

**Figure 2. PDStack task flowchart**

<img src = "images/pdstacktask.png" width = "600"/>

<br>

The PDStack middleware library implements the state machines defined in the [USB Type-C Cable and Connector](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-cable-and-connector-specification-revision-20) and the [USB Power Delivery](https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-power-delivery) specifications. PDStack consists of the following main modules:

- **Type-C manager:** Responsible for detecting a Type-C connection and identifying the type of connection. It uses the configurable Rp/Rd terminations provided by the USB PD block and the internal line state comparators. The Type-C manager implements the state machines defined in the *USB Type-C Cable and Connector specification* and provides the following functionality:

    - *Manage CC terminations*: Applies Rp/Rd terminations according to the port role

    - *Attach detection*: Perform the required debounce and determine the type of device attached

    - *Detach detection*: Monitor the CC line and VBus for detecting a device detach

- **Protocol Layer:** Forms the messages used to communicate between a pair of ports/cable plugs. It is responsible for forming capabilities messages, requests, responses, and acknowledgements. It receives inputs from the policy engine indicating which messages to send and relays the responses back to the policy engine.

- **Policy engine:** Provides a mechanism to monitor and control the USB Power Delivery system within a particular consumer, provider, or cable plug. It implements the state machines defined in the *USB Power Delivery* specification and contains implementations of all PD atomic message sequences (AMS). It interfaces with the protocol layer for PD message transmission/reception for controlling the reception of message types according to conditions such as the current state of the port. It also interfaces with the Type-C manager for error conditions like Type-C error recovery.

- **Device policy manager (DPM):** Provides an interface to the application layer to initialize, monitor, and configure the PDStack middleware operation. The DPM provides the following functionality:

    - Initialize the policy engine and Type-C manager

    - Start the Type-C state machine followed by the policy engine state machine

    - Stop and disable the Type-C port

    - Allow entry/exit from deep sleep to achieve low power based on the port status

    - Provide APIs for the application to send PD/Type-C commands

    - Provide event callbacks to the application for application-specific handling

The PDStack library uses a set of callbacks registered by the application to perform board-specific tasks such as turning the consumer/provider power path ON/OFF and identifying the optimal source power profile to be used for charging. In this example, these functions are implemented using the appropriate APIs provided as part of the peripheral driver library (PDL).

The stack also provides notification of various connection and PD policy state changes so that the rest of the system can be configured as required.

The application tries to keep the PMG1 MCU device in deep sleep, where all clocks are disabled and only limited hardware blocks are enabled, for most of its working time. Interrupts in the USB PD block are configured to detect any changes that happen while the device is in sleep, and wake it up for further processing.

An overvoltage (OV) comparator in the USB PD block is used to detect cases where the power source is supplying incorrect voltage levels and automatically shut down the power switches to protect the rest of the components on the board.

### Compile-time configurations

The PMG1 MCU USB PD DRP EPR application functionality can be customized through a set of compile-time parameters that can be turned ON/OFF through the *config.h* and *Makefile* file.

| `SYS_DEEPSLEEP_ENABLE` | Enables device entry into deep sleep mode for power saving when the CPU is idle | 1u or 0u |

<br>

### PDStack library selection

The USB Type-C connection manager, USB Power Delivery (USB PD) protocol layer, and USB PD device policy engine state machine implementations are provided in the form of pre-compiled libraries as part of the PDStack middleWare library.

Multiple variants of the PDStack library with different feature sets are provided; you can choose the appropriate version based on the features required by the target application.

   - *PMG1_PD3_DRP_EPR*: Library with support for USB Type-C DRP EPR operation and USB PD Revision 3.1 messaging. This library is chosen by default.



### USB PD port configuration

The properties of the USB-C port including the port role and the default response to various USB PD messages can be configured using the **EZ-PD&trade; Configurator** tool of ModusToolbox.

**Note:** This example is supported by EZ-PD&trade; Configurator 1.20. Lower versions of the tool will not support this example due to the absence of Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) configuration for the source.

By default, the parameters have been set to the appropriate values for a Power Delivery sink application. To view or change the configuration, click on the **EZ-PD&trade; Configurator 1.20** under **Tools** section in the Quick Panel to launch the configurator tool.

**Figure 3. USB Type-C port configuration using EZ-PD&trade;  configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_port_info.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

Properties of the USB-C port are configured using the *Port Information* section. Because this application supports the DRP role, the **Port Role** must be set as **Dual Role** and **DRP Toggle** must be enabled. Other parameters such as **Manufacturer Vendor ID** and **Manufacturer Product ID** can be set to desired values.


**Figure 4. Sink capability configuration using EZ-PD&trade; configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_sink_cap.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

The power capabilities supported by the application in the sink role are specified using the *Sink PDO* section. See the *USB Power Delivery* specification for details on how to encode the various sink capabilities. A maximum of seven PDOs can be added using the configurator.

**Figure 5. Source capability configuration using EZ-PD&trade; configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_source_cap.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

The power capabilities supported by the application in the source role are specified using the *Source PDO* section. See the *USB Power Delivery* specification for details on how to encode the various source capabilities. A maximum of seven PDOs can be added using the configurator.

**Figure 6. Extended sink capability configuration using EZ-PD&trade; configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_skedb_info.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

The *SKEDB* section is used to input the extended sink capabilities response that will be sent by the application when queried by the power source. See the Power Delivery specification for details on the extended sink capabilities format.

**Figure 7. Extended source capability configuration using EZ-PD&trade; configurator**

<img src = "images/ezpd_scedb_info.png" width = "800"/>

<br>

The *SCEDB* section is used to provide the extended source capabilities to the power sink device. See the *USB Power Delivery* specification for details on the extended source capabilities format.

Once the parameters have been updated as desired, save the configuration and build the application.

For quick verification of the application configurability, disable the **PD Operation** parameter under **Port Information**. When the PMG1 MCU device is programmed with this modification, you can see that the user LED blinks at a slower rate even when connected to a power source that supports USB Power Delivery.
